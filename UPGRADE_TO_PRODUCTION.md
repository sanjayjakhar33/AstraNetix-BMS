# 🚀 Render Free Tier to Production Upgrade Guide

**Ready to move from testing to production? Here's how to upgrade your AstraNetix BMS deployment.**

## 🎯 When to Upgrade

### Upgrade to Starter Plan ($25-50/month) when you need:
- ✅ **Always-on services** (no sleeping after 15 minutes)
- ✅ **Better performance** (1GB RAM, 0.5 CPU per service)
- ✅ **Custom domains** (your-isp.com instead of random Render URLs)
- ✅ **Priority support** (faster response times)
- ✅ **Increased limits** (more database storage, bandwidth)

### Upgrade to Professional Plan ($100-200/month) for:
- ✅ **High-traffic support** (2GB+ RAM, 1+ CPU per service)
- ✅ **Multiple ISP deployments** (separate environments)
- ✅ **Advanced monitoring** (metrics, alerts, logging)
- ✅ **SLA guarantees** (99.95% uptime commitment)
- ✅ **Dedicated support** (direct access to Render team)

## 📋 Upgrade Process

### Option 1: Upgrade Existing Services (Recommended)
```bash
# For each service in your Render dashboard:
1. Go to service → Settings → Plan
2. Change from "Free" to "Starter" or "Professional"
3. Update environment variables if needed
4. Redeploy if configuration changes required
```

### Option 2: Deploy New Production Environment
```bash
# Use the full production blueprint:
1. Fork repo (if using original): github.com/sanjayjakhar33/AstraNetix-BMS
2. Go to: https://render.com/deploy
3. Select: render.yaml (instead of render-free-tier.yaml)
4. Choose paid plans for all services
5. Deploy to new environment
```

## ⚙️ Production Configuration Changes

### 1. Environment Variables
Update these settings for production:

```env
# Performance optimizations
MAX_WORKERS=4              # Increase from 1
DB_POOL_SIZE=20           # Increase from 5
CACHE_TTL=3600            # Increase from 300

# Security
DEBUG=false               # Keep disabled
SSL_ENABLED=true          # Keep enabled
CORS_ORIGINS=your-domain.com  # Restrict to your domain

# Features
CDN_ENABLED=true          # Enable for better performance
AI_ENABLED=true           # Enable AI features with API keys
PAYMENT_LIVE_MODE=true    # Enable real payments
```

### 2. Custom Domains
```bash
# For each frontend service:
1. Service → Settings → Custom Domains
2. Add your domain (e.g., portal.your-isp.com)
3. Configure DNS CNAME records as shown
4. Wait for SSL certificate provisioning
```

### 3. Database Optimizations
```bash
# Upgrade database plan:
1. Database → Settings → Plan
2. Choose appropriate size based on usage
3. Consider backup policies
4. Set up monitoring alerts
```

## 🔐 Production Security Checklist

### Essential Security Updates
- [ ] **Change all default passwords** (database, admin accounts)
- [ ] **Set up proper CORS origins** (remove wildcard *)
- [ ] **Configure environment secrets** (move sensitive data to Render secrets)
- [ ] **Enable audit logging** (track all admin actions)
- [ ] **Set up backup schedule** (database + file backups)

### API Security
- [ ] **Rate limiting** configured for all endpoints
- [ ] **JWT secret** properly randomized (not generated default)
- [ ] **API versioning** implemented for stability
- [ ] **Input validation** enabled for all user inputs

### Infrastructure Security
- [ ] **Database encryption** at rest enabled
- [ ] **Redis AUTH** configured if available
- [ ] **HTTPS only** (redirect HTTP to HTTPS)
- [ ] **Security headers** configured

## 💳 Payment Gateway Setup

### For Real Transactions
```env
# Stripe (Recommended)
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# PayPal
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_live_client_id
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_live_client_secret
PAYPAL_MODE=live

# Razorpay (for Indian market)
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_live_...
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=...
```

## 🤖 AI Features Setup

### OpenAI Integration
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4
OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=0.7
```

### Google Gemini Integration
```env
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=AI...
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-1.5-pro
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Alerts

### Essential Monitoring
- [ ] **Uptime monitoring** (external service like Pingdom)
- [ ] **Database performance** (connection pool, query time)
- [ ] **Application metrics** (response time, error rate)
- [ ] **Resource usage** (CPU, memory, disk)

### Alert Configuration
```bash
# Set up alerts for:
- Service downtime (> 2 minutes)
- Database connection failures
- High response times (> 5 seconds)
- Memory usage (> 80%)
- Disk space (> 90%)
```

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

### Backend Optimizations
```env
# Increase worker processes
MAX_WORKERS=4

# Optimize database connections
DB_POOL_SIZE=20
DB_MAX_OVERFLOW=10

# Enable caching
REDIS_ENABLED=true
CACHE_TTL=3600
```

### Frontend Optimizations
```env
# Enable production optimizations
GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false
REACT_APP_CDN_ENABLED=true

# Optimize builds
NODE_ENV=production
BUILD_PATH=build
```

## 💰 Cost Optimization Tips

### Starter Plan Optimization
- Use **Starter plan** for low-traffic ISPs (< 1000 users)
- **Share Redis** between services to save cost
- **Use PostgreSQL Free** tier if data < 1GB
- **Monitor usage** to avoid overages

### Professional Plan Benefits
- **Autoscaling** handles traffic spikes automatically
- **Better resource allocation** reduces overall costs
- **SLA guarantees** reduce downtime costs
- **Priority support** reduces troubleshooting time
